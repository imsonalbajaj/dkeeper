# dkeeper

Welcome to the new dkeeper project.
If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd dkeeper/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

## About
Its basically a simple todo app where i use react on front end side.

And for backend purpose i use internet computer blockchain, and motoko stable variables so that your list does not get lost even after you keep refresing and re-deploying.
